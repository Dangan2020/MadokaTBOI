    <description>Never seen anyone else doing a Madoka Magica mod (aside from the soundtrack mod by PixelDemise, only has up to AB+, no repentance music) so I thought I'd try to make one.

This is my first time ever making mods for TBOI, any feedback is welcome. (I might make this open source for everyone's contribution)

Madoka's stats:
2 Red + 2 Soul Hearts
0.80 Speed
3.00 Tears
2.00 Damage
6.60 Range
1.00 Shot Speed
1 Luck
Starts with Cupid's Arrow &amp; Epiphora (temporary starting items, might change them in a future update).

Tainted Madoka's stats (might revamp the look to have a more edgier/darker look in a future update):
4 Hearts
1.00 Speed
2.31 Tears
4.50 Damage
6.60 Range
0.6 Shot Speed
-3 Luck
Exclusive item: Soul Gem.

Special Thanks:

Sanio - Character Costume Protector (yeah I didn't want to draw new costumes lol)
