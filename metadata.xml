    <description>[January 9th - Notes: FINALLY fixed the mod. I dunno what came over me to just give it up but it should be functional again now. I still need some ideas to make the character more unique, any ideas are welcome to send in the suggestion thread!]

Never seen anyone else doing a Madoka Magica mod (aside from the soundtrack mod by PixelDemise, only has up to AB+, no repentance music) so I thought I'd try to make one.

This is my first time ever making mods for TBOI, any feedback is welcome. (I might make this open source for everyone's contribution)

Madoka's stats:
2 Red Hearts
0.80 Speed
3.00 Tears
2.00 Damage
6.60 Range
1.00 Shot Speed
1 Luck
Starts with Cupid's Arrow, Epiphora (temporary starting items, might change them in a future update) &amp; Hierophant Tarot Card.

Tainted Madoka's stats (might revamp the look to have a more edgier/darker look in a future update):
4 Hearts
1.00 Speed
2.31 Tears
4.50 Damage
6.60 Range
0.6 Shot Speed
-3 Luck
Exclusive item: Soul Gem.

Special Thanks:
The modding community for coding support.
